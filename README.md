## Features

- Displays all Pokémon from Gen 1 through Gen 9.
- Uses official data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
- Some Pokémon feature animated sprites for a more lively experience.
- Fully built in **HTML (with embedded CSS and JavaScript)**.
- Simple and clean UI that's easy to navigate.
- Responsive layout (works on desktop and mobile).

## How It Works

- This project pulls Pokémon data dynamically from the PokéAPI.
- Each Pokémon entry includes its name, sprite (animated if available), and ID.
- All logic and layout is handled within a single `HTML` file — because I’m lazy.
